# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why is your nickname JakeClark?**
A: When I played my first game, Lords Mobile, I didn't have any ideas for my nickname. So I chose 2 characters from another game, Jake and Clark, combined them together, and that became my nickname.

**Q: Why is your avatar for most social media accounts a picture of Kanade Yoisaki?**
A: In the past, I played Project Sekai, and I really love Kanade - her clothes, her hobbies (composing music), and the way she "makes people happy".

**Q: Besides spending time learning about information security, what do you do in your free time?**
A: I listen to lo-fi music from Chillhop Music, especially Chillhop Essentials. I also collect music from SoundCloud and use DJ software like Rekordbox (mobile) to play them however I want. I just don't like "industrial" music, like how some YouTube videos remix and transition between songs.

**Q: Why did you choose Information Security as your main path? Why not AI?**
A: I was inspired by some YouTubers playing Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges. They magically solved challenges and captured the flag, almost like how coding tournaments work. So I wanted to delve deeper into how they solved these challenges, and also how hackers work. I wasn't really thinking about what's inside AI besides the hard mathematics formulas, especially when LLMs weren't growing as fast as they are now.

**Q: What is your main goal with Information Security and AI applications?**
A: I want to understand how Red Teams work, like how hackers operate, to find better solutions for Blue Teams. I also want to automate that process using AI, making AI my best companion ever.
