# All GitHub Projects

**Toxic Positivity Survey**
My first website ever, built by myself when I was 17 years old, using Python Bottle as the backend, vanilla HTML, CSS, and jQuery as the frontend, and MySQL for database queries. Hosted on free PythonAnywhere. The main purpose was to provide a new way to collect user experiences about toxic positivity, as an alternative to Google Forms, for scientific research purposes.
*GitHub: (private repository)*

**ToDo List with Mini-games**
My second website, built with 4 other people. It was a to-do application using tags, filtering, calendar, and creative mini-games to encourage users to complete their to-dos. The technologies included Python Flask as the backend, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and MySQL. Hosted on DigitalOcean with a domain from Namecheap.

**Multiplayer Chess (C# .NET)**
A C# .NET application for multiplayer chess, using TCP to communicate with other players on the same LAN or to play against a bot. Used WinForms to develop the GUI, and Firebase as the NoSQL database.

**Network & Web Service Monitor**
A website built for administrators to monitor WiFi/LAN networks and web services. Inspired by Raspberry Pi monitoring solutions. Built with Python Django for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend, deployed completely with Docker. This website has a clean interface for admins to easily monitor everything in real-time.
