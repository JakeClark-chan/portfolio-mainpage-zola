Inspired by Pi.Alert, this application serves as a complete dashboard for administrators.
- Real-time network monitoring: Continually watches and instantly detects any new or unexpected devices joining the LAN or WiFi infrastructure.
- Web service uptime tracking: Automatically sends heartbeats and monitors the status and availability of different web services.
- Fully Dockerized setup: Easily portable, meaning it runs on both Linux and Windows operating systems seamlessly via Docker Compose.
- Tech stack: Built by coordinating Python Django for the core backend engine, alongside ReactJS providing a deeply responsive administrator frontend.
