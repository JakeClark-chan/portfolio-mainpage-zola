This project represents my first foundational steps into web development as a teenager.
- Research data collection: Rather than resorting to Google Forms, a dedicated interface gathered qualitative inputs regarding "toxic positivity" interactions for a personalized scientific study.
- Full-stack solo build: Coded entirely from scratch relying exclusively on the Python Bottle framework for the backend, vanilla HTML/CSS/jQuery for the frontend, and straightforward MySQL for database queries.
- Cloud deployment: Successfully hosted online using PythonAnywhere's free tier, maintaining stability for real-world user access.
